# MNIST Digit Recognition Neural Network

## About
This is a solution to the MNIST-dataset, consisting of 60,000 classified 27x27
greyscale images of handwritten digits. The solution is a fully connected
feed forward neural network that achieves 97.4% accuracy on the set. 

## Motivation
The MNIST-dataset is considered one of the fundamental datasets in the world of
machine learning and neural networks. This project serves as a "Hello World" to
the field. 
This exercise was meant to give some practical insight into how to work with
FCNNs using Keras and the Tensorflow backend. It always serves as a playground
for testing out more advanced features such as data augmentation etc.. 

## Solution
The solution can be found in a documented 
[Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/vegarab/mnist-digit-recognition-nn/blob/master/docs/mnist-project.ipynb) 
in `docs/mnist-project.ipynb`. The full source is found in `src/mnist.py`.

A full evaluation of the models used are found in the notebook.

## How to run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
